### **Feature Design**

* **Multi-Source Compilation:**

  * To provide a well-rounded view of each industry by compiling news from various sources, ranging from mainstream media to niche industry journals
  * By aggregating multiple sources, the service minimizes bias and offers a more comprehensive understanding of each topic. Users benefit from gaining insights from different angles, which can aid in better decision-making and broader knowledge

* **Industry-Specific Filters:**

  * This feature allows users to tailor their news feeds to specific industries of interest, such as technology, finance, healthcare, or any other sector relevant to their professional or personal needs
  * Users receive highly relevant information, saving time and increasing efficiency by filtering out unrelated content. This targeted approach helps users stay informed about specific sectors, which is especially beneficial for professionals who need to keep up with industry trends and developments


* **Recommendation - Customized Keyword:**

  * Deliver personalized news experiences by providing news headlines that are directly relevant to the user's searched keywords
  * Increases user engagement by ensuring the news content is highly relevant to the user's interests. Enhances user satisfaction by tailoring content delivery to individual preferences, thus making news consumption more targeted and less time-consuming

* **Natural Language Query Search:**

  * Enhance user interaction with the platform by enabling them to perform complex queries using natural language, facilitating an intuitive and conversational interaction with the news aggregation service
  * The NLQI provides a deep contextual understanding of user queries, enabling the platform to tailor content curation beyond simple keyword matching

* **Article Summary:**

  * Aid users in quickly grasping the essence of lengthy documents, articles, or reports without the need to go through the entire text, which is especially useful in environments where time and quick understanding are of the essence
  * Leverage OpenAI's latest generative models, to provide concise, accurate summaries of extensive textual content



### **Deliverables**

* A fully functional news aggregation system that filters and displays news according to specific industries such as technology, healthcare, finance, sports, and more

* A sophisticated query-handling module capable of interpreting complex natural language inputs and returning highly relevant news articles

* A personalized recommendation engine that dynamically suggests news articles based on the user's keyword preferences

* Reduces information overload by distilling complex information into digestible summaries, enabling users to make faster and more informed decisions. Increases productivity by allowing users to consume more information in less time

### **Project Flow**

 Start by registering in our application to personalize your news experience. Once registered, log in to discover the specific features:
 
* Customized Keywords Recommendation :- If the user has a specific keywords in mind and wants news only related to those, he/she can store those keywords and the feed will only have similar content to it when he/she clicks on Recommend Headlines. If not, he /she can just click on Recommend Headlines to get the top news
* Industry Specific Filters :- If the user has a specific industry which he wants to watch, he/she can chose it and the page would be further displayed with only the news from the speicifc industries
* Summary Generation :- This is the page where he/she can select a specific industry and select a specific headline to summarize
* Natural Language Query Search :- User can enter a news search query to get a specific output
